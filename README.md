# HYPOTHYROID-PREDICTION

# Description #

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients,Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid using at least 2 out of the 3 advanced decision tree models: Random forests, Ada boosted trees,gradient boosted trees and build SVM model
